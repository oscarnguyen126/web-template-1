                It&apos;s not necessary, but if you want, you can ping me at @mikamatikainen on Twitter when using this
                file. Would be just nice to see how this evolves :-)

                This file is using platform-native typefaces for iOS & macOS, designed by Apple.

                Just for reference or if you&apos;re interested,
                I list here the typefaces I&apos;m using in on the live site at https://www.nordicrose.net.
                If you&apos;d like to use them in your own project,
                I added links for you as well to make it easier to purchase the required license.
